# Binary-Classification
Binary Classification / horse-human using Tensorflow and Keras using InceptionV3 model and adding 4 extra layers at the end.Data augmentation is done using image generator.The link of the dataset is given in the code.
The code is implemented in Google Colab.
The model can also be tested on real life high quality images.
The training Accuracy of the model is 99.8%.
